		<p>The strategy should work as it is advertised to. So you should expect to double your principal investment multiple times, given enough time. It is up to you, whether or not that amount is enough to satisfy your needs. The more money you prepare at an earlier time, the more it will accumulate to.</p>
	</div>

	<div class="flip">
		<a href="#" class="questions"><h5>I don’t have any savings at all. Is this still something that I should be looking into?</h5></a>
	</div>
	<div class="panel">
		<p>It depends on your opportunity costs. Before investing in the market, where the returns are gradual, see if there are rewarding ways to invest in yourself. This may be in the form of an education, training, etc. Especially for low sums of money, these choices offer more potential ROI.
		</p>
	</div>

	<div class="flip">
		<a href="#" class="questions"><h5>I’m being told to invest in a certain amount of stocks and bonds. How do I buy them?</h5></a>
	</div>
	<div class="panel">
		<p>We recommend investing in these assets through low cost index funds. There are many to choose from. If you are at a loss, we recommend the following:<br> 
		 -Vanguard Total Stock Market Index Fund (VTI) <br>
		-Vanguard Total Bond Market Index Fund (BND)<br>
		-Vanguard Total International Stock Index Fund (VXUS)<br></p>

		<a href="#"><h5 class="questions">This strategy seems boring. Won’t I make more money day-trading?</h5></a>
	</div>
	<div class="panel">
		<p>If you are so talented and gifted, perhaps. But for the overwhelming majority of people, they’d see better results just investing and holding onto index funds. This saves you time and hassle, especially when it comes to taxes.</p>
	</div>

	<div class="flip">
		<a href="#" class="questions"><h5>Aren’t credit cards bad? Why are you recommending one for me?</h5></a>
	</div>
	<div class="panel">
		<p>If you are a follower of Dave Ramsey’s advice, then you might think so. But no, they are not inherently ‘bad’. They are only bad if misused, and the same logic would apply to any other line of credit.<br><br>A credit card is a revolving line of credit, and a very useful tool. If anything, to help you build up your credit score, which is an important assessment of your reliability and trustworthiness towards financial contracts. And if you use them correctly, credit cards offer reward points, that while miniscule, can add up over time to help you claim meaningful prizes.</p>
	</div>

	<div class="flip">
		<a href="#" class="questions"><h5>How accurate is the expected growth calculator?</h5></a>
	</div>
	<div class="panel">
		<p>The expected growth calculator uses the long-term historic performance of given asset types, and assumes that they will continue on this trend. It should be accurate given a long enough period of time, but is guessing at best for shorter periods.</p>

  <div class="flip">
    <a href="#" class="questions"><h5>How does the Portfolio Builder work?</h5></a>
  </div>
  <div class="panel">
    <p>Our Portfolio Builder algorithms are based on effective passive investing strategies. They determine an efficient asset allocation based on your investment goals and risk preferences.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="flip">
    <a href="#" class="questions"><h5>How do I get started on investing?</h5></a>
  </div>
  <div class="panel">
    <p>You first need to create a brokerage account. That will allow you to transfer in funds and make the investments you want. For beginners, we recommend Vanguard, which offers no fees when you trade the funds they manage.</p>
