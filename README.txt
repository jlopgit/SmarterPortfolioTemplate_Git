Smarter Portfolio Template

This template was designed using the bootstrap framework which allows for a more dynamic website for smaller devices. The structure was written in HTML, the style was in CSS, the script to retrieve user data was in Javascript, and the script to manipulate HTML elements was written in JQuery.
